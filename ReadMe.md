## Page Rank
 Page rank Matlab implementation.
### Iterative
 Read the graph that represents the web pages and then create the adjacency matrix and the matrix K that consists of 1 / numberOfNeighbors(i) in cells (i, i) on the main diagonal and 0 in the other cells. Then it computes the PR vector iteratively.
### Algebraic
 Read the inputs in the same fashion as before. To calculate X ^ -1 I use Gram-Schmidt and SST. After Q and R are found through factorization, SST is used for R and the columns of Q transposed in order to calculate the inverse of the matrix, column by column.
### Appartenance
 Reads the val1 and val2 values from the last 2 lines of the input. The function used for computing the appartenance factor is u(x) = 0 for x in [0, val1), u(x) = a * x + b for x in [val1, val2] and u(x) = 1 for x in (val2, 1]. I've chosen a = 1 / (val2 - val1) and b = -val1 / (val2 - val1) respectively.
### Output
 The program outputs the PR vector generated by the iterative approach, then the PR vector generated by the algebraic method. Lastly, it show a ranking of the important pages.
